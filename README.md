## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle Length as well as the Ground Clearance is statistically shown to have the greatest impact on the MPG values on the dataset. The slope is not considered to be zero because the R-Sqaured value is .71. This linear model does not predict the MechaCar prototypes effectively because the intercept reflects that there are still variables missing that may affect the MPG.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
As a whole the manufacturer specification to keep the varaince under 100psi per coil is achieved. But when comparing the individual lots, Lot 3 is far past the vaiance of 100 PSI per coil with a total of 170.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The Total sample from yhe test shows that the p-value is  .06 with a mean value of 1498.8.

The results for Lot1 and Lot2 show similar results.

The result of Lot3 shows that the p-value is .45 and a mean valu of 1498.78.
